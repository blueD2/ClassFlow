# ClassFlow
won 1st place in Ed Tech at WiCS Hacks 2018

ClassFlow facilitates interaction between students and a teacher, creating a more effective learning environment. It minimizes interruptions and tailors pace to student responses.

With this app, students don't need to feel self-conscious about asking "dumb" questions or understanding the material so little they don't even know what questions to ask. Instead, they can provide a teacher with constant feedback about the pacing of the lesson, ask questions anonymously, or submit their name to be called on.

Teachers can view how comfortable their students feel in an instant, and can more effectively time answering questions so they don't interrupt the flow of learning.

Created by Eleni Georgiou, Eshani Kaul, and Nila Selvaraj using IBM's Internet of Things platform.
Both student and teacher UI can be accessed here: https://classflow.mybluemix.net/ui
